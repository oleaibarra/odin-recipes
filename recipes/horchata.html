    <h2>Traditional Mexican horchata</h2>

    <p>
        One of the reasons Horchata is very popular in Mexico, is that it's the perfect pairing for spicy and flavorful
        meals.

    <p>
        Making Horchata is very simple. The hardest part is waiting for it to soak. After that, making it is a breeze!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>12 ounce can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>12 ounce can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>8 cups of warm water - divided</li>
        <li>Sugar to taste</li>
        <li>Ground cinnamon to garnish - optional</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla - optional</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Place the rice in a colander and rinse under cold water.
                Place the rice, cinnamon sticks (see note #1 below) and 4 cups of water into a bowl.
                Cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight (preferably) or a minimum of 4 hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Once you're ready to blend the rice, remove most of the cinnamon sticks
                but it's okay to leave small pieces with the rice.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Blend the rice in two separate batches by adding 1/2 of the rice and water
                with some of the cinnamon stick left behind.
                Puree until it's very smooth and forms a watery paste like texture. About 4 minutes long.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Using a very fine strainer (or some cheese cloth) pour the blended mixture over a pitcher.
                Strain out as much liquid as possible, pushing on the solids with a spatula or spoon.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Repeat this process for the rest of the rice, water & cinnamon mixture.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Stir in the canned milks, vanilla, and the additional 4 cups of water.
                Stir well until everything is incorporated.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Taste and add sugar or water if needed according to taste.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Chill and stir well before serving over ice.
                It's normal to have some rice paste sink to the bottom of the jar/glass.
                Just stir before you serve and enjoy!
            </p>
